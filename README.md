# Cognosphere-website
Our mission here at Cognosphere is to provide students K-8 with free technology education; introducing and providing them with the fundamentals needed to succeed later on in life. We believe it shouldnâ€™t matter how rich or poor a person is; that everyone deserves the opportunity to learn, grow, and prepare for the future that lies before them. Whether we like it or not, the further we develop and advance as a society, the more vital coding becomes. Cognosphere wants to help your child stay ahead of the curve with our cost-free, instructional program.
